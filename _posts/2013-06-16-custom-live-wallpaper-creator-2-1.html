<p>You said, we listened. This update now allows you to export the source code of the Live Wallpaper.</p>

<p>In addition to letting you export the source code, the following changes have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>The application is now able to check for updates automatically on start-up to ensure you are always using the latest and greatest version</li>
<li>A settings dialog has been added to allow you to configure the directory for storing the Live Wallpaper source code and to toggle the ability to check for updates on start-up</li>
<li>The check for updates dialog has undergone a significant change and is much more streamlined than before</li>
<li>The phone preview now displays a simple black background instead of the previous image placeholder</li>
<li>The image placeholder has been redesigned</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the Live Wallpaper name being rejected if it was not a single word</li>

<li>All references to http://android.shake-se.com have been changed to the new site, https://www.customlivewallpapercreator.com</li>
