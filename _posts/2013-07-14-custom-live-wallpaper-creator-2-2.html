<p>Ever wanted to create your very own Matrix Live Wallpaper? Well, now you can with CLWC 2.2.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-369" alt="CLWC Version 2.2 - Matrix Design Screen Preview" src="/assets/images/content/post-2013-07-14-custom-live-wallpaper-creator-2-2-img-2.png" width="300" height="228" /></p>
<p>In CLWC 2.2, not only can you create your very own Matrix Live Wallpaper with your own text and choice of font colour, we have also made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with APK installation utility not installing APK files (we accidentally introduced this bug in version 2.1, sorry :()</li>
<li>Performance improvements - less RAM is consumed when building Live Wallpapers</li>
<li>Updated Android SDK to the latest version</li>
<li>Updated ANT library to the latest version</li>
<li>Java JDK/JRE is no longer a prerequisite, the internally bundled JDK/JRE is now used</li>
<li>Removed unneeded Live Wallpaper template files</li>
<li>Redesigned the About dialog which now displays social media links to Facebook and Google+, also it shows you if any updates are available</li>
<li>The Check for Updates option has been removed from the menu as it has now been merged with the new About dialog</li>
</ul>
<p>So why not head on over to our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download">Download</a> page and get your hands on the latest version.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to say thank you to everyone who tested version 2.2 and provided us with excellent feedback.</p>
