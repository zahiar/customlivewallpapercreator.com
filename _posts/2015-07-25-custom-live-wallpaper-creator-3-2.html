<p>More options! We've listened to you and have added more options to help you better customise the Live Wallpapers.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First and foremost, you can now alter the speed of the Animated GIF Live Wallpaper, so you can speed it up or slow it down.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-641 size-full" src="/assets/images/content/post-2015-07-25-custom-live-wallpaper-creator-3-2-img-2.png" alt="CLWC 3.2 - Animated GIF LWP Render Options" width="531" height="81" /></p>
<p>The first option determines how often a frame is drawn on screen, for example if set to 1000 (in milliseconds), it will draw a frame every second. If set to 0, it will draw as fast as possible (depends on how powerful your phone is).</p>
<p>The second option determines which frame to draw. As the GIF is treated as a video clip internally therefore it has a duration so setting this to 100 means that the frame at intervals, 0, 100, 200, 300, 400 &hellip; up until the end of the clip is rendered.</p>
<p>So just play around with these options until you are happy with the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, you can now also alter the speed of the Matrix Live Wallpaper, so make it faster or slower, it's up to you.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-625 size-full" src="/assets/images/content/post-2015-07-25-custom-live-wallpaper-creator-3-2-img-3.png" alt="CLWC 3.2 Preview 2 - Change Matrix Animation Speed" width="495" height="212" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So after fulfilling those two requests, we also improved CLWC visually and squashed a few bugs here and there.</p>
<p>One of the most noticeable changes is the new phone preview, which is bigger than before so you can truly see how your Live Wallpaper will look on your phone.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-623" src="/assets/images/content/post-2015-07-25-custom-live-wallpaper-creator-3-2-img-4.png" alt="CLWC 3.2 Preview 2 - Reworked Preview" width="165" height="300" /></p>
<p>We've also improved the Live Wallpaper installer tool, so you can now install multiple Live Wallpapers (or any APK file) at once. We've updated its UI to match CLWC's 3.0 design.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-614" src="/assets/images/content/post-2015-07-25-custom-live-wallpaper-creator-3-2-img-5.png" alt="CLWC 3.2 Preview 1 - APK Installation" width="300" height="287" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, here are the bugs we've squashed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug where the Signing Key icon was incorrectly labelled as "LWP"</li>
<li>Fixed bug&nbsp;where certain non-English characters would cause the Live Wallpapers to fail to build (thank you марина for informing us of this)</li>
<li>Fixed bug where CLWC would let you create a Live Wallpaper without specifying its name</li>
<li>Fixed bug with Animated GIF Live Wallpaper background options not working (thank you eric for reporting this)</li>
<li>Fixed bug with certain letters such as 'p' and 'y' getting cut-off during the Matrix Live Wallpaper animation</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As ever, the new version can be found on our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download">Download</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
