<p>We've replaced the old Nexus 4 preview with a newer, bigger one, so now you can preview your Live Wallpaper's with much better clarity.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-625 size-full" src="/assets/images/content/post-2015-05-24-second-preview-of-clwc-3-2-img-2.png" alt="CLWC 3.2 Preview 2 - Change Matrix Animation Speed" width="495" height="212" /></p>
<p>We've also added support for changing the Matrix animation speed, so you can customise it to your liking. Please note that a faster animation speed might make the Live Wallpaper use more battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've also made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug where CLWC would let you create a Live Wallpaper without specifying its name.</li>
<li>Fixed bug with Animated GIF Live Wallpaper background options not working (Thank you eric for reporting this).</li>
<li>Attempt to fix an issue where a small number of users get the following error when trying to build a Live Wallpaper: "Error: Unable to find built APK file"</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone gets the error above or is unable to build a Live Wallpaper, then please send us the log file generated by CLWC to us so that we can analyse it and hopefully find a fix for this issue.</p>
<p>The log file will be placed in the folder you installed CLWC into, for example:<br />
C:\Program Files\Custom Live Wallpaper Creator\build_log.txt</p>
<p>Please send this to us, support[at]customlivewallpapercreator.com</p>

<p>We look forward to hearing your feedback on this, and hopefully we can release this soon, if all goes well.</p>
