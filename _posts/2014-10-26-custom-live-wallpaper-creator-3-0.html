<p>The newly redesigned CLWC 3.0 is finally here!</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>CLWC always lacked a good design and with this release we hope to address that with this.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-514" src="/assets/images/content/post-2014-10-26-custom-live-wallpaper-creator-3-0-img-2.png" alt="CLWC 3.0 Redesign" width="300" height="254" /></p>
<p>But that's not all, we have made a number of other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some users reported problems with the APK installer, so we've made some tweaks to it to make it even better</li>
<li>Some of the Live Wallpapers have been improved and are now more stable and much lighter on battery usage</li>
<li>A little message is now displayed when you hover your mouse over one the Live Wallpapers explaining what it is</li>
<li>Completely redesigned and reworked the Settings area</li>
<li>As requested by many users, you can now set a custom package name in the Settings area</li>
<li>Another popular request was to be able to use your own signing key, which you can now set in the Settings area</li>
<li>When selecting images, a preview is now displayed as you select them</li>
<li>Fixed the &ldquo;Fit to screen&rdquo; scaling option</li>
<li>You can now set a version number for the Live Wallpaper</li>
<li>You can now set the &ldquo;Background&rdquo; option to &ldquo;none&rdquo; (Will simply display a black background)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the Live Wallpaper failing to build if you had special characters in the description</li>
<li>Removed the user guide (we plan on expanding the online support section)</li>
<li>Java is now bundled in, so you don't need to install that any more</li>
<li>Many more under-the-hood tweaks and optimisations</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, thank you to everyone who helped test the previews we released and to all those who have reported issues/ideas to us. We very much hope you continue to provide us with feedback in order to help us further improve CLWC.</p>
