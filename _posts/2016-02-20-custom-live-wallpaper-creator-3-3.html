<p>A new year with a new version of CLWC. In 3.3, all Live Wallpapers now correctly display when the screen is rotated, and you can even lock them to portrait/landscape orientation only. Plus some other changes.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>So starting with the new big feature, all Live Wallpapers will now correctly display when the device is rotated and you can even lock the orientation so no matter how you rotate your device, the image will always display in the chosen orientation.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-687 aligncenter" src="/assets/images/content/post-2016-02-20-custom-live-wallpaper-creator-3-3-img-2.png" alt="Shake LWP Orientation Feature Preview" width="275" height="77" /></p>
<p>Each of the Live Wallpapers will have the following new options (except the Matrix Live Wallpaper as that will always auto-rotate):</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-rotate - as you rotate your device, the Live Wallpaper will be rescaled and rotated to match the orientation</li>
<li>Portrait only - as you rotate your device, the Live Wallpaper will not rotate and will remain in portrait&nbsp;view</li>
<li>Landscape only - as you rotate your device, the Live Wallpaper will not rotate and will remain in landscape view</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, we've also cleaned up the Rotate Live Wallpaper so that the black borders which were previously visible as the image was rotated are now gone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we've also made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimised Animated GIF &amp; Shake Live Wallpaper's battery efficiency</li>
<li>Fixed bug where setting a background image and then changing it to a colour would not clear the previously set image</li>
<li>Minor text tweaks</li>
<li>Under the hood tweaks and optimisations</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As ever, the new version can be found on our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download">Download</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>Any feedback you have would be greatly appreciated.</p>
