<p>Since we released the first preview of CLWC 4.0 a couple of weeks ago, there has been a lot of interest with it especially the Video Live Wallpaper.&nbsp;So we've just put up a new preview which adds options for scaling the video.</p>

<p>The three options for video scaling are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original - this displays the video as it is without scaling it</li>
<li>Letter boxed - this scales the video down to as much of the screen as possible without distorting it</li>
<li>Stretched - this stretches the video to fill the entire screen</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a visual illustration of&nbsp;the options.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the Video Live Wallpaper should rotate correctly on devices where the homescreen rotates. The Nexus 5's home screen does not rotate but the one on the Nexus 7 does, and the Video Live Wallpaper does rotate correctly on there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try out the new scaling options and let us know how you get on by posting comments below.</p>
